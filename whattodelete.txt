CLEANUP PROCEDURE
================

STEP 1: BACKUP IMPORTANT DATA
- Copy EHC_Data/, EHC_Data_Merge/, EHC_Data_Pdf/ to backup location
- Copy EHC_Logs/ to backup location (centralized logs)
- Backup config/ directory
- Backup any custom modifications

STEP 2: DELETE DEBUG FILES
- Delete all .png files (debug screenshots)
- Delete debug HTML files
- Delete large text debug files

STEP 3: DELETE OLD TEST FILES
- Delete old test scripts
- Delete old app versions
- Delete old monitoring files

STEP 4: CLEAN DIRECTORIES
- Clean downloads/ directory
- Clean temp/ directory
- Clean __pycache__/ directories
- Delete old logs/ directory (replaced by EHC_Logs/)

STEP 5: VERIFY SYSTEM
- Run: python enhanced_service_runner.py
- Test: python test_complete_workflow.py
- Test: python test_8_file_minimum.py
- Check: All essential files still present
- Verify: EHC_Logs/ directory exists and is active

ESTIMATED SPACE SAVINGS
=======================
By deleting the recommended files, you can save approximately:
- Debug images: ~2-3 MB
- Large text files: ~1-2 MB
- Old test files: ~500 KB
- Old logs directory: ~100 KB
- Old documentation: ~200 KB
- Total estimated savings: ~4-7 MB

AUTOMATED CLEANUP FEATURES
==========================
The system now includes automated cleanup:
- EHC_Logs/ files auto-deleted after 7 days
- Dynamic folders auto-cleaned after 2 months
- Log rotation for large files
- Automatic space management

FINAL VERIFICATION
=================
After cleanup, verify these commands work:
1. python enhanced_service_runner.py
2. python test_complete_workflow.py
3. python test_8_file_minimum.py
4. npm run dev (if using frontend)
5. Check EHC_Logs/ for active logging

CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS
====================
✅ Dynamic file system operational (DDmonth format)
✅ 8-file minimum guarantee implemented
✅ Centralized logging in EHC_Logs/ with 7-day auto-cleanup
✅ Login timeout issues resolved
✅ Business hours enforcement (9 AM - 5 PM)
✅ Health monitoring every 5 minutes
✅ Email notifications functional
✅ Monthly data cleanup scheduled

If any issues occur after cleanup, restore from backup and investigate.
The system is now optimized for automatic operation with minimal manual intervention.
