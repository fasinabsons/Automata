VBS (Absons IT ERP) Automation Master Plan - UPDATED FOR BACKGROUND OPERATION
================================================================================

## OVERVIEW
Complete automation system for VBS (Absons IT ERP) software to:
- Launch application and handle security popups
- Login with precise form filling (Company: IT, Financial Year: 01/01/2023, Login ID: vj, Password: empty)
- Navigate to WiFi User Registration section
- Import Excel files and generate PDF reports
- Email notifications with attachments
- **NEW: Background operation with immunity for other applications**

## PHASE 1: APPLICATION LAUNCH & LOGIN (BACKGROUND OPERATION)
================================================================================

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Form Field Order** (as per user specification):
   - Cursor starts at Password field by default
   - Navigate UP to Company dropdown → Fill "IT"
   - Move to Financial Year dropdown → Fill "01/01/2023" 
   - Move to Login ID field → Fill "vj"
   - Password field → Leave EMPTY
   - Click OK button (with O underlined)

2. **Background Operation Requirements**:
   - Use direct Windows API calls (SendMessage/PostMessage)
   - Target only VBS window handle - no global input simulation
   - Prevent interference with other applications
   - No pyautogui global clicks/typing - only direct window messaging
   - Ensure other applications remain immune to automation

3. **Form State Handling**:
   - Detect and handle LoginEmpty.png scenario (rdsr in field)
   - Prevent form shrinking by proper timing and window management
   - Restart application if form becomes inaccessible
   - Wait for complete form stabilization before interaction

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:

#### A. Window-Specific Automation (35 Years Experience Approach):
```
1. Get VBS window handle using FindWindow/EnumWindows
2. Use GetWindowThreadProcessId to ensure we target correct process
3. Use SendMessage/PostMessage for ALL input (no global simulation)
4. Implement proper window focus without affecting other applications
5. Use GetDlgItem or similar to identify form controls
6. Direct control messaging instead of coordinate-based clicking
```

#### B. Robust Form Navigation:
```
1. Detect current cursor position (password field)
2. Use WM_KEYDOWN with VK_TAB + SHIFT to navigate backwards:
   - Shift+Tab → Login ID field
   - Shift+Tab → Financial Year dropdown  
   - Shift+Tab → Company dropdown
3. Fill each field using WM_SETTEXT or WM_CHAR messages
4. Navigate forward using VK_TAB to next field
5. Verify field contents before proceeding
```

#### C. Background Security Popup Handling:
```
1. Monitor for security dialogs using EnumWindows in separate thread
2. Use direct window messaging to handle popups (Alt+R, Enter)
3. No global keyboard simulation - only targeted window messages
4. Ensure popup handling doesn't affect other applications
```

#### D. Form Shrinking Prevention:
```
1. Detect window size/position changes
2. Restore window to proper size if shrinking detected
3. Implement timing delays based on application response
4. Use window state monitoring to detect readiness
```

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE FOR BACKGROUND OPERATION
================================================================================

### Core Components:

1. **WindowManager**: 
   - Manages VBS window handles
   - Ensures target-specific automation
   - Provides immunity for other applications

2. **DirectInputHandler**:
   - Replaces pyautogui with direct Windows API calls
   - SendMessage/PostMessage for all input
   - Window-specific keyboard/mouse simulation

3. **FormController**:
   - Maps form controls using window hierarchy
   - Provides direct control access methods
   - Handles form state management

4. **BackgroundMonitor**:
   - Monitors VBS application state in background thread
   - Handles security popups without user interference
   - Maintains automation state awareness

### API Calls to Implement:

```python
# Core Windows API calls for background automation:
- FindWindow/FindWindowEx: Locate specific controls
- SendMessage/PostMessage: Direct window messaging  
- GetWindowThreadProcessId: Process-specific targeting
- SetWindowPos: Window management without global focus
- GetDlgItem: Direct control access
- WM_SETTEXT: Direct text input to controls
- WM_COMMAND: Menu and button activation
