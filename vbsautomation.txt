VBS AUTOMATION INTEGRATION
==========================

INTEGRATION WITH MAIN SYSTEM:
==============================
✅ The VBS automation is fully integrated with the main WiFi automation system
✅ Triggered automatically after Excel file generation (8-file minimum reached)
✅ Runs as part of the enhanced service workflow
✅ Includes email notifications for success/failure
✅ Logs all activities to EHC_Logs folder

TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
==================
🎯 VBS automation is triggered when:
- 8 CSV files have been downloaded to today's folder
- Excel file has been generated successfully
- System is running during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- No existing PDF report for today exists

WORKFLOW SEQUENCE:
==================
1. CSV Download (corrected_wifi_app.py) → Downloads 4 CSV files
2. File Count Check → Ensures 8 total files in today's folder
3. Excel Generation (generate_excel_now.py) → Creates Excel file
4. VBS Automation Trigger → Starts VBS workflow
5. PDF Generation → Creates PDF report via VBS
6. Email Notification → Sends completion email

BAT FILES AND VBS AUTOMATION
============================

WHICH BAT FILES INCLUDE VBS:
============================
✅ start_enhanced_service.bat - Includes VBS automation
✅ start_full_system.bat - Includes VBS automation
❌ start_frontend.bat - Frontend only, no VBS
❌ start_backend_only.bat - Backend only, no VBS

VBS AUTOMATION EXECUTION:
=========================
🎯 When you run start_enhanced_service.bat:
   - Starts the enhanced service runner
   - Includes VBS automation capability
   - Triggers VBS after 8-file minimum reached
   - Runs complete workflow automatically

🎯 When you run start_full_system.bat:
   - Starts both backend and frontend
   - Backend includes VBS automation
   - Frontend provides monitoring dashboard
   - Full system with VBS capability

FRONTEND CONNECTION ISSUE
=========================

FRONTEND + BACKEND CONNECTION:
==============================
📋 ISSUE: Frontend not connecting when BAT file is running

🔧 SOLUTION: Use start_full_system.bat for frontend + backend
   - This BAT file starts BOTH services
   - Backend runs in one window
   - Frontend runs in another window
   - Dashboard available at http://localhost:3000

📋 CORRECT PROCEDURE:
1. Run start_full_system.bat (as Administrator)
2. Wait for both services to start
3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
4. Dashboard should connect to backend

📋 ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE:
1. Run start_backend_only.bat (as Administrator)
2. Wait for backend to start
3. Run start_frontend.bat (in separate command prompt)
4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

SUMMARY
=======
The VBS automation system is a comprehensive solution that automates the complete
process of importing Excel files into the AbsonsItERP application and generating
PDF reports. It consists of 4 main phases, each handled by specialized modules,
with a master orchestrator managing the entire workflow.

The system is fully integrated with the main WiFi automation system and triggers
automatically when the 8-file minimum is reached. It includes robust error handling,
comprehensive logging, and email notifications for all operations.

All VBS automation files are located in the modules/ directory and are ready for
production use. The system has been thoroughly tested and is currently deployed
and operational.

To run the system with VBS automation, use either start_enhanced_service.bat or
start_full_system.bat. The frontend connection issue can be resolved by using
start_full_system.bat which properly starts both backend and frontend services.
